## Description

I create  application using a started code from a Booting camp course. I build the back end for an e-commerce site. 
I learn:  
    - how to create queries using SQL.  
    - how to make a connection to the database using mysql2.   
    - how to use Sequelize as a ORM.  
    - how to use  dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like a user’s MySQL username, password, and database name.
